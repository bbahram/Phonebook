# Phonebook

One of my academic projects is Phonebook. In this project, I make a matrix using linked lists to save numbers in alphabetical order by the owner's name. I also use files to save the phonebook in a text file. I used linked lists for this matrix to provide a dynamic matrix in one of its dimensions. <br>
This project was written in 2018 and developed in C++.
